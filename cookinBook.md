## COOKIN' BOOK

**Project description:** This application is currently in an unfinished state. The app provides a space for users to input their own custom recipes. From the home page the user can open a form which will require the user to enter a title, category, step amount and ingredient amount. Upon tapping the 'add' button the recipe navigation is added to a listview where users can then, through text fields, enter ingredients and cooking instructions.
