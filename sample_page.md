**Project description:** Sampler is an iOS application that I have been working on over the course of the past few months. I intended for this app to have a simple and intuitive UI. There are four tabs on the application: sample, sequence, track and edit. Each of the first three tabs allow the user to add a new music creation tool, where the fourth tab enables users to effectively store, access and edit their audio samples.
