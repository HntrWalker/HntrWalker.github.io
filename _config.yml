  Developer and Musician
  <br><br>
  I am always looking to learn new things. 
  Along with my degree I have also worked 
  through a number of extra courses, furthering 
  my understanding of calculus, discrete 
  mathematics, linear systems, and statistics. 
  I have worked on and built a number of iOS 
  applications utilizing the SwiftUI framework, 
  these projects have all been pursued on my 
  own volition. I am currently spending much 
  of my time delving into the topics of data 
  visualization and analysis using Python. 
  I am also a songwriter/producer and have 
  released multiple records. My interests in 
  both technology and the arts and how those 
  two worlds can come together have fueled 
  my pursuits. I am actively applying for 
  roles related to Data Science and Engineering.
